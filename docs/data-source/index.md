# Data Sources

Data Sources are collections of data that can be linked to Templates and Generators. For example a Data Source could contain monsters from Dungeons & Dragons 5e, so that the monsters can be used in a Template.

Sales & Dungeons supports additional import formats. Currently supported are:

- **CSV**: Tabular data
- **Fight Club 5e XML**: Data from the Fight Club 5e xml files
- **FoundryVTT**: Data from FoundryVTT modules
