# Printer Setup

Depending on Operating System and Printer the possible setup methods will be different. Setup methods to get your printer up and running will be collected here. If you have problems with setting up a printer or can confirm that a method worked or doesn't work please visit our Discord. We are happy to help and will add new information you provide here and to the printer settings page.

For information about specific thermal printer models check [Tested Printer](../models).

## Windows

For Windows, it is recommended to start by trying the [Generic Windows Driver](./windows-generic) setup. If this doesn't work you can either try using manufacturer supplied drivers or [LibUSB](./libusb).

## Linux & Mac

For Linux & Mac, it is recommended to start by trying the [CUPS](./cups) setup. If this doesn't work you can either try using manufacturer supplied drivers or [LibUSB](./libusb).
