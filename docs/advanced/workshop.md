# Publish to the Workshop

The Workshop is a new addition to Sales & Dungeons since Version ``0.6.0``. In the Workshop you can browse community content and download & import it right there in a few clicks.

## Publishing Content

- To publish your own content you need to have a git repository containing all the content as separate folders.
    - If you want to see a example take a look at this repository: https://github.com/BigJk/snd-bigjk-templates
- It's recommended to use the default folder names that are generated if you export a template, generator or data source as folder from S&D.
- The top-level `README.md` will be shown inside of S&D when browsing to your package.
- After that you want to drop by the **Sales & Dungeons Discord** and post your repository in the `#repo-request` channel so we can add it to the public packages.
